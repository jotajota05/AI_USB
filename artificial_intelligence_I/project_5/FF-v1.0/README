This directory contains the C implementation of FF-v1.0, the first STRIPS version of the FF planner.

make

Which produces an executable named

ff

Usage should be self-explanatory. Running ff without any parameters
prints out a brief help information about the parameters that are
applicable, which basically come down to specifying the domain and
problem files.

Have fun,
